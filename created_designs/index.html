              This package includes all tasks and pages created using html, css
              features. Package is divided in some other packages to help to
              orientate between exercise types. All these projects do not include
              any functionality.

                    This package consists of projects that were created by using
                    different features and properties - everything that I have
                    learned so far. Some tasks have simple designs without any
                    adaptability for mobile devices.
